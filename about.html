        Bolo Restaurant</p>
        <p style="color: azure; font-size: 30px; float: left;">Bolo Restaurant is our love letter to our home in East Africa - <br>An introduction to the life, culture, and food of the East African people. <br>
            From the moment you arrive at Bolo Restaurant Lavington or <br>
            Bolo Restaurant Waterfront, to the moment you leave, <br>you will be enthralled by the sights and smells of East Africa. <br>
            If you are what you eat, then Bolo Restaurant is a kind of edible <br>portrait: a celebratory, intelligent, often modern rendering of how <br>the founders want to commemorate East African heritage in Kenya.

<p style="font-size: 60px; color: azure;">The Founders</p>
<p style="color: azure; font-size: 30px; float: left;">From her days as a young girl in Kenya, cooking has always been <br>one of Dyna Wanjiku’s strengths. 

    When she said “I do” to Bolo <br>Grace in 2006, Dyna was tethered to the kitchen; always crafting, <br>perfecting and discovering new and classic authentic East African <br>cuisine. 
    
    Cooking for her family is her way of reconnecting and <br>sharing in the restorative powers of East African culture and its <br>delicacies. Her husband and kids are her tasters, her guinea pigs <br>and her greatest critics. 
    
    The Bolo’s traveled all over the globe, and <br>so did Dyna’s cooking. She mastered and perfected several East <br>African dishes. 
    
    Dyna’s Goat Pepper Soup is downright delicious, <br>loved by her sundry friends and family from all the world. She <br>cemented her years of effort by bringing world-class stylings of her <br>authentic East african cuisines to Bolo Restaurant in 2014.
    
    Her <br>Goat Pepper Soup and other delectable meals now feature in the <br>Bolo Restaurant Lavington and Bolo Restaurant Waterfront menus. <br>
    
   Edward Maina (Maina’s) second home is in the kitchen preparing <br>delicious meals. As a boy, he spent hours beside his mother, <br>cooking and trying new recipes. It was a space where Maina felt <br>truly at home – with the warmth emanating from the live fire, and <br>his mama’s quick glances and instructions that sent a wave of <br>excitement every time they cooked together.
    
    These moments were <br>filled with first time experiences, moments of sheer wonder, <br>and quiet interludes that strengthened their bond and solidified <br>Maina’s lifelong passion and dedication to authentic East African <br>delicacies. </p>

<p style="color: azure;"><em>Bolo Restaurant in 2014</em></p>

<p style="color: azure;  font-size: 30px; float: right;">Today, Maina cherishes and immortalizes his mother by sharing <br>some of her recipes with Bolo Restaurant – Remembering her, <br>relearning the tastes and textures and foods that she gave him. He <br>still has an original handwritten recipe that is proudly framed and <br>put on display at Bolo Restaurant Lavington. He may be inclined to <br>show it to you, if you ask nicely.

    Maina already had a Ghaniaian <br>restaurant in Kampala, Uganda, but when the Bolo’s invited him <br>to collaborate in opening a East African restaurant in Kenya, he <br>could not resist.
    
    Eventually, Black Rock Capital Ltd., (Kris and <br>Nina Senanu) provided enough capital and their own individual <br>strengths, such as marketing, for Bolo Restaurant to open its doors in <br>2014.
    
    After spending over 20 years in Kenya, Kris saw the need for <br>an authentic East African restaurant that served his favourite meals <br>from his home in Ghana. When approached by Dyna, Bolo and <br>Maina, he was elated to invest in the dream and be part of the <br>team that brings a taste of home to Kenya. 
    
    Working together, the <br>founders re-discovered their roots in their journey to bring a taste <br>of East Africa to Kenya.
    
    This dual heritage and ardor for home <br>gave rise to Bolo Restaurant Lavington the place to find a taste of <br>authentic East African meals in Nairobi’s diverse community. <br>
    
    Somewhere in the middle, between East African pride, curiosity <br>and ambition, Bolo Restaurant Waterfront opened its doors in Karen <br>8 years later. </p>

    <p style="font-size: 60px; color: azure;">Our Philosophy</p>
    <p style="color: azure;  font-size: 30px; float: left;">The inventiveness of the founders helped them sidestep cultural <br>and generational barriers to create a wonderful place to wine, dine <br>and unwind. 

        Bolo Restaurant is now the leading authentic East <br>African restaurant in Kenya.
        
        True to its name, all meals are <br>inspired by their mama’s cooking, using fresh spices, herbs and <br>ingredients sourced both locally and from their motherland.
        
        When <br>you walk into the Lavington and Waterfront restaurants, you will <br>realise that Bolo Restaurant is as much about East African life, <br>music, and family as it is about cooking.
        
        We are proud to be at the <br>helm of a burgeoning movement. 
        
        It’s a radical openness: the sense <br>that when you eat at Bolo Restaurant, you’re tasting not just a cheffy <br>concoction, but a part of East Africa.
        
        We welcome you, your <br>friends and family to join us at Bolo Restaurant Lavington or Bolo <br>Restaurant Waterfront for a hearty, delicious and authentic East <br>African meal. 
        
        Sanu da zuwa! Wabe fie! Now, you’re <br>home!
