        <b>The Guru lounge is a whole world in itself, wrapped in daily West African life, <br>and thought interwoven with community. <br>

        The variety of drinks and beverages available at <br> Guru lounge Lavington or Guru lounge Waterfront are unique tapestries of the world. <br>
        
        Take a walk with top shelf spirits, <br> liqueurs and chasers. <br>
        
        Journey around the world with Guru's on trend,  <br>adventurous and extensive selection of wines. <br>
        
        Arrive at a warm sandy beach with a chilled cocktail. <br> 
        
        The Guru lounge is the perfect antidote to the realities of the world. <br>
        
        Revered as a fine watering hole for <br>those who dwell near or far, the lounge is <br> decorated with framed photos that make you feel like you just stepped out of a scrapbook of a bustling West African city. <br> 
        
        The vibe ranges from alcohol-nerd symposium to sports-central bar, <br>depending on the time of day/night and if there’s a <br> LIVE game playing on the large TV screen. <br>
        
        The Guru lounge embodies the spirit of family and community, <br>so however your day or week went, wherever the evening may take you,<br> your experience at the lounge is memorable and pleasurable.</b>
